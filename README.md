MERN Stack Virtual Stock Trading Platform

Uses the MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)


**Design**

I was tasked with creating a full stack web app that would allow users to buy and sell stocks (with virtual money). As such, from the outset I was concerned with a few things:

    User Authentication
    Accurate Stock Data
    Responsive Data Storage

**Stock Data**

I chose to use the the (https://www.alphavantage.co/)[AlphaVantage API] for my stock data as it was accessable and provided data in the minimum frequency that was required (daily).

**Databases**

I chose MongoDB, and by extension Mongoose.js (ORM) and MongoDB Atlas due to its quick prior experience with the technology due to its ability to access data quickly

**Notes** - npm install will have to be run both in the root folder and the client folder.
